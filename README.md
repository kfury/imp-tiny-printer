================

Squirrel code for hooking up an Electric Imp to a small thermal printer

Thermal printer I used: https://www.adafruit.com/products/600

YouTube video demo: http://youtu.be/5q95HSfw-CQ


To do:
 * Create an Instructables guide to show how to wire this up.
 * Include cleaned up PHP and HTML pages for 'feeding' the printer, including nice things like automatic word wrapping.
